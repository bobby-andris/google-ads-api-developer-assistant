**Date:** December 30, 2025  
**Objective:** Execute a data-driven turnaround of Search campaign performance and align top-performing attributes across all channels.

## 1. Executive Summary: The Search-Attribute Mismatch

Our 90-day Search audit has identified a critical **Targeting-Attribute Mismatch**. While the account structure is solid, your current Search campaigns are bleeding budget on low-intent generic terms while completely missing the "Alpha" attributes (like Matte Black) that are currently carrying your Shopping ROI.

**Top Revenue Opportunity:** Immediate recovery of **$522.16/quarter** by removing a single non-converting keyword ("unlacquered brass rod") and scaling the **Matte Black** search gap.

## 2. Search Efficiency Audit (Last 90 Days)

### **The "Bleeder" Triage (Immediate Profit Recovery)**
These keywords are driving significant spend with zero to low return.

| Keyword | Spend | ROAS | Match Type | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **unlacquered brass rod** | **$522.16** | **0.00** | PHRASE | **REMOVE IMMEDIATELY** |
| **avondale decor** | $111.39 | 0.00 | PHRASE | **REMOVE** |
| **towel rack** | $109.63 | 0.53 | PHRASE | **TIGHTEN TO EXACT** |
| **unlacquered brass grab bar**| $55.26 | 0.00 | EXACT | **PAUSE** |

### **The "Hero" Foundation (Scale Targets)**
These keywords are your current revenue anchors.

| Keyword | ROAS | Match Type | Campaign |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **allied brass** | **9.93** | EXACT | Branded - US |
| **paper towel holder** | **5.59** | PHRASE | Generic - PHRASE |
| **standing toilet tissue** | **3.83** | EXACT | Generic - EXACT |

## 3. Strategic Gap: The "Matte Black" Search Vacuum

- **The Discovery:** Our Shopping audit proved that **Matte Black** is your most efficient attribute (**13.95 ROAS**). 
- **The Gap:** Your Top 10 Search keywords **do not contain the word "Black."** You are winning the "Visual" auction in Shopping but completely forfeiting the "Intent" auction in Search.
- **The Action:** Deploy the **"Matte Black Alpha" Search Layer** (Exact match ad groups for matte black towel bars, mirrors, and hooks).

---

## 4. The "Valet Rod" Discrepancy

- **Shopping Performance:** 32.78 ROAS (High efficiency).
- **Search Performance:** 0.90 ROAS (Inefficient).
- **Diagnosis:** This is a **Landing Page Friction** issue. The Shopping ad sends users to a specific SKU image. The Search ad likely sends them to a generic collection. 
- **Action:** Rewrite Search Ad Copy to emphasize "Retractable / Designer Quality" and point to the specific high-converting SKU page found in Stage 2.

---

## 5. Revised 72-Hour Search Action Plan

### **A. Cleanup (Stop the Bleed)**
- Remove `unlacquered brass rod` and `avondale decor` from all RSA campaigns.
- Consolidate `allied brass` queries into the Branded campaign only (using negatives in all others).

### **B. Expansion (The Alpha Layer)**
- Launch **Matte Black** and **Satin Brass** specific ad groups in the `Generic - EXACT` campaign.
- Use **Attribute-Specific Headlines** (e.g., "The Original Matte Black Bathroom Set").

### **C. Efficiency (Match Type Tightening)**
- Move `paper towel holder` from PHRASE to EXACT to prevent matching with low-intent queries like "how to make a paper towel holder."
